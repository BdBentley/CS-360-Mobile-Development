# CS-360-Mobile-Development
Repository for SNHU Computer Science Mobile Development Course

### Introduction
This course dealt with Mobile development and creating a mobile application in Android. 

### Requirements
Our requirements were to build a mobile application in Android Studio using Java. We were to choose an application from three different "templates" or style of application. There was an inventory application, event tracker, and listing application. I chose the event tracker application with the understanding that it would become a workout tracking application mainly for weightlifting.

### Design Process
The design process for this course involved creating sequence and UML diagrams in order to flesh out our design and what I planned to create. Throughout this process, we were to document and keep track of changes in our design.

### Testing Process 
The testing process for Android studio is very intuitive and built into the Android Studio application. While writing the XML code for the application, it appears in real-time in the development window. This allows you to create new components and pages on the fly for you application. To test the code and functionality of the application itself, we were to run it in a test environment. Android studio allows you to test it on a real physical device, or test it on an emulated device of your choosing. The testing methods in Android Studio allow incredibly dynamic development and real time testing.
